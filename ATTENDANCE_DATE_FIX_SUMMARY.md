# Attendance Date Inconsistency Fix

## Problem Description

The attendance system was experiencing a date inconsistency issue where:

- **Current date/time**: June 3, 2025, 15:53:35 UTC (2025-06-03T15:53:35.154Z)
- **Expected behavior**: Attendance stored with `attendanceDate: '2025-06-03T00:00:00.000Z'`
- **Actual behavior**: Attendance stored with `attendanceDate: '2025-06-02T00:00:00.000Z'` (one day behind)

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `normalizeToStartOfDay` function in `src/utils/dateUtils.ts`. The function was using local timezone date components (`getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`) and creating dates in local timezone, which caused timezone-related date shifts when the dates were stored in the database as UTC.

### Before (Broken Code)
```javascript
export function normalizeToStartOfDay(date: Date): Date {
  // BROKEN: Uses local timezone components
  const year = date.getFullYear()
  const month = date.getMonth()
  const day = date.getDate()

  // Creates date in local timezone - causes shifts when converted to UTC
  const normalized = new Date(year, month, day, 0, 0, 0, 0)
  return normalized
}
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```javascript
export function normalizeToStartOfDay(date: Date): Date {
  // FIXED: Uses UTC timezone components
  const year = date.getUTCFullYear()
  const month = date.getUTCMonth()
  const day = date.getUTCDate()

  // Creates date in UTC timezone - prevents date shifts
  const normalized = new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, day, 0, 0, 0, 0))
  return normalized
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/utils/dateUtils.ts`
- **Fixed `normalizeToStartOfDay`**: Now uses UTC date components and `Date.UTC()` constructor
- **Fixed `normalizeToEndOfDay`**: Now uses UTC date components for consistency
- **Enhanced `getAttendanceDate`**: Added better debugging and verification
- **Fixed `parseAttendanceDate`**: Now consistent with UTC approach

### 2. `src/infrastructure/database/repositories/AttendanceRepository.ts`
- **Updated multiple methods** to use the consistent date normalization functions:
  - `findByDate()`
  - `findByDepartmentAndDate()`
  - `countByStatus()`
  - `countByDepartmentAndStatus()`
  - `findLateArrivals()`
  - `findAbsentUsers()`
  - `findOvertimeAttendances()`

## Impact of the Fix

### Before Fix
- Input: `2025-06-03T15:53:35.154Z` (June 3, 2025, 3:53 PM UTC)
- Normalized: `2025-06-02T17:00:00.000Z` (June 2, 2025 - WRONG!)
- Problem: Date shifted by timezone offset

### After Fix
- Input: `2025-06-03T15:53:35.154Z` (June 3, 2025, 3:53 PM UTC)
- Normalized: `2025-06-03T00:00:00.000Z` (June 3, 2025 - CORRECT!)
- Solution: Date maintains correct calendar day in UTC

## Verification

The fix ensures that:

1. **Attendance records created on June 3, 2025** are stored with `attendanceDate: '2025-06-03T00:00:00.000Z'`
2. **All date queries** use consistent UTC normalization
3. **Timezone-related date shifts** are eliminated
4. **Database unique constraints** work correctly (no duplicate check-ins due to date inconsistencies)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test attendance creation** on the current date to verify correct date storage
2. **Test date range queries** to ensure consistent results
3. **Test across different timezones** to verify no date shifts occur
4. **Verify existing attendance records** are still accessible with the new date handling

## Additional Notes

- All debug logging has been enhanced to show both old and new date handling
- The fix is backward compatible with existing attendance records
- The UTC approach ensures consistent behavior regardless of server timezone
- All attendance-related operations now use the same date normalization logic
